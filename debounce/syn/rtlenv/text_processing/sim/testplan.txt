text_processing Testplan

This test achieves 100% code, branch, and expression coverage.All the test cases
are automatically verified.

Test cases
A.Send two identical strings of same length,different length strings identical
  upto the last character of the shorter one,checking whether it returns true using
  the 'strcmp' function.
B.Send character with any of these arguments ‘ ‘, LF, HT, CR, VT, NUL, checking
  'is_whitespace' function whether it returns true for such arguments.
C.Verify if 'skip_whitespace' skips a character if the next character of the
  argument is a whitespace.
D.Send strings separated by whitespace, checking 'extract_string' function.
E.Verify 'extract_comment' function by sending text and checking whether it
  extracts the remaining text as a string or data.
F.Send different values : positive/negative numbers, signed/unsigned, Binary,
  Hexadecimal, Values with don't cares, all Std_logic values (i.e. 'Z', 'H', 'U',
  'X', etc.) checking extract_num function.
G.Send binary numbers by having whitespaces,don't cares,signed/unsigned checking
  how 'extract_bin' function works.
H.Send hexadecimal numbers by having whitespaces,don't cares,signed/unsigned
  checking how 'extract_hex' function works.
I.Read a file,checking 'get_line','open_text' and check_eof' conditions.
J.Verify line with strings. The line has to match identically with the string

There are six input stimulus files :
1: input_num.txt has wide range of numbers covering all possible cases for testing
   extract_num,extract_hex and extract_bin procedures. There are few special
   characters as well. If using Slickedit,to view all of those characters,please
   enable them by clicking View -> special characters.

2: input_stim.txt has stimulus for testing extract_str,extract_comment procedures.

3: input_fileio_check.txt for checking the open_text,check_eof,get_line.

4: empty_file.txt for reading an empty file.

5: whitespace_chars.txt to check ‘ ‘, LF(0XA),HT(0X9),CR(0XD),VT(OXB),NUL(00).
   There are few special characters also. Using Slickedit, you can enable them
   by selecting View -> special characters.
6: find_str_stim.txt, this file contains string combinations that are used
   to verify the find_and_remove_string method.

Running the tests:
  To run all tests execute:
      ..\sim> vsimsa -tcl \components\tools\tcl\RTL_make.tcl

Coverage statistics will be saved in the coverage.html file.
